In this project I have created Client - Server connection where a text file with different characters is being transferred from 
client to server, edited on the server side and sent back. The amendmendmends on the server side are following: there can be as many spaces in the file, however, they all should be deleted and counted as one.
Mainly, that's what implemented in this project using C++.
